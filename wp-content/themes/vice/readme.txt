A starter theme called vice.

== Description ==

Hi. I'm a blogging theme called vice, if you like. Write beautiful blogs using this theme.
In the Vice child theme, Blog Masonry layout is there that is not present in the parent theme. Posts on the main page are showing in the masonry layout.


== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.


== Keyboard navigation ==

Keyboard navigation is working properly in the forward direction by using the tab key. For the reverse direction, Shift+Tab key is working on all the parent menus and if the dropdown menus are open then it is working on it. The focus is moving back to the parent menu having submenus from the next menu in a reverse direction.
